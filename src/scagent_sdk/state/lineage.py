"""Executor-owned artifact lineage: identity signatures, fact scope, and forest topology.

Session facts merge by identity and always converge. The H5AD chain merges only by whichever path
the model passed forward, so a capability that adds columns can derive from a sibling artifact and
silently drop another capability's contribution from the delivered file. Identity cannot detect that
-- both branches carry the same identities -- so topology has to be recorded separately.

This module holds the pure, side-effect-free half of that design: what an identity signature is,
which fact roots belong to a node rather than the session, and how a committed execution is
classified against the current forest. The executor owns the mutations; nothing here touches disk.

Specification: ``docs/artifact-lineage-and-head-spec.md`` (v2.2), decisions D1, D2, D10.
