# Skill catalog and taxonomy

Status date: 2026-07-27  
Discovered inventory: **21 skills, 20 executable skills, 48 tools**.

## How the catalog is organized

The filesystem remains a flat discovery root at `.claude/skills/<skill-id>/`. Categories below are
conceptual: they help the model find the right capability without adding nested discovery logic or
an umbrella pipeline.

- **Orchestration** contains concise reasoning and branch-selection guidance, never the scientific
  implementation of every step.
- **Workflow science** owns evidence/decision transitions such as preparation, doublet review,
  cluster QC, batch diagnosis, annotation adjudication, and publication.
- **Library/method adapters** wrap a focused external scientific method with strict inputs,
  provenance, artifacts, state effects, and environment routing.
- **Open/reference models** provide non-final annotation evidence that must be reconciled with
  current DEGs and biological context.
- **Utilities** provide bounded inspection, media, web, and auditable workspace capabilities.

Skills can carry secondary tags. For example, CellBender is both a library adapter and an optional
preprocessing branch; marker annotation is both workflow evidence and a method implementation.
RAPIDS-singlecell is mainly an execution environment shared by focused skills, not one giant
`sc-rapids` workflow skill.

## Current packages

| Category | Skill | Tools | Environment | Enforced floors | Current maturity and known limits |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestration | `orchestrate-single-cell` | prompt-only | n/a | n/a | Active concise workflow/resume guidance; must stay non-DAG and defer method detail to focused skills |
| Utility | `analysis-workspace` | `list_workspace`, `read_text_file`, `run_shell_command`, `run_analysis_code` | current; `gpu-singlecell` for code | none | Iris is trusted in-process execution with complete code/command/stdout/stderr provenance, ordinary imports and shell syntax, and only a narrow catastrophic-command refusal. It is explicitly not a security sandbox; OpenShell is the future Spark/Linux isolation boundary |
| Utility | `inspect-dataset` | `inspect_dataset`, `describe_dataset` | current; `gpu-singlecell` for describe | none | Live fingerprint/container identity plus a judgment-free H5AD content report (shape, X/layer/raw value facts, obs/var column facts, embedding/uns keys, gene-identifier signals) with backed/sparse/GPU-safe value sampling; verified live on a backed 43k-cell file |
| Utility | `inspect-media` | `inspect_image`, `inspect_pdf` | current | none | Live image pixels and rendered PDF-page evidence; bounded previews/text |
| Utility | `research-web` | `web_search`, `fetch_web_page` | current | none | Live Tavily path for documentation and public pages; requires `TAVILY_API_KEY`. HTML is extracted via Tavily `/extract` with a local fallback (`extraction_backend` records which) |
| Utility | `research-literature` | `search_literature`, `fetch_article_fulltext` | current | none | Europe PMC (MEDLINE/PubMed + PMC + preprints); keyless. Structured PMID/PMCID/DOI records with review/preprint/open-access flags and open-access full text. Claim/source schema and context relevance matching remain future work |
| Workflow science | `single-cell-counts` | `materialize_count_matrix` | `gpu-singlecell` | none | Standalone H5AD/10x raw-count resolution and materialization; live CRC execution from a blank session |
| Workflow science | `single-cell-qc` (0.2.0) | `calculate_single_cell_qc`, `review_single_cell_qc`, `filter_single_cells`, `filter_single_cell_genes` | `gpu-singlecell` + current review | finalization requires `current_cell_qc_review` | Auto count-source resolution, MT/ribo metrics, six standard QC figures, evidence-bound visual review, and separately confirmed mutation |
| Workflow science | `expression-preprocessing` | `normalize_single_cell_expression`, `select_highly_variable_genes` | `gpu-singlecell` | none | Normalization and HVG selection are independent, artifact-in/artifact-out operations |
| Workflow science | `dimensionality-reduction` | `compute_single_cell_pca`, `build_single_cell_neighbors`, `compute_single_cell_umap` | `gpu-singlecell` | none | PCA, graph construction, and UMAP are separate; each validates only the representation it consumes |
| Workflow science | `single-cell-clustering` | `cluster_single_cells`, `rank_single_cell_groups` | `gpu-singlecell` | none | Leiden and group-wise gene ranking are independent; UMAP and cluster QC are not prerequisites |
| Workflow science / method | `doublet-evidence` | `evaluate_doublet_evidence`, `review_doublet_evidence` | `gpu-singlecell` | review requires `current_doublet_evidence` | Deterministic tests and live PBMC Scrublet run; Scrublet-as-probability eval added, broader model conservatism evals still to run |
| Workflow science | `cluster-qc` (0.6.0) | `evaluate_cluster_qc`, `review_cluster_qc` | `gpu-singlecell` + current review | finalization requires current resolved review | Three-axis evidence, per-cluster metric boxplots, cluster/QC UMAP, every eligible covariance heatmap, explicit visual adjudication, and optional bounded cleanup |
| Workflow science | `batch-investigation` (0.5.0) | `investigate_batch`, `decide_batch_handling` | `gpu-singlecell` | decision requires `current_batch_evidence` | Portable, artifact-driven gene-first evidence (enriched regions, within-sample identity DEGs, cross-sample matching, direct comparison, recurring programs, design confounding) with a two-axis verdict, split from an identity-bound decision that gates integration; composition/Cramér's V/mixing are advisory. Deterministic + bounded-live verified. Model evals and a cross-runtime diffxpy bridge remain |
| Workflow science | `marker-annotation` (0.4.0) | `evaluate_marker_evidence`, `review_annotation_evidence` | `gpu-singlecell` + current review | finalization requires current reviewed evidence | Group-wise DEG/marker evidence plus DEG-primary cross-method review; two references when available or a specific waiver |
| Workflow science | `finalize-analysis` (0.4.0) | `finalize_analysis` | `gpu-singlecell` | `dataset_identity`, `current_cell_qc_review`, `current_cluster_qc`, `batch_decision`, `current_annotation_evidence` | Complete label validation plus state-derived comprehensive report, automatic caveats, final figures, and ordered capability-call recipe |
| Library/method adapter | `cellbender-background-removal` | `validate_cellbender_input`, `remove_ambient_background` | `cellbender` | identity; removal also requires current suitability | Strict raw-droplet refusal/routing/lineage/failure contracts and partial live GPU run; no completed corrected-matrix biological claim |
| Library/method adapter | `scvi-integration` | `train_scvi_latent` | `scvi` | none | Training produces model + `X_scVI` only; neighbors, UMAP, clustering, comparison, and adoption are separate |
| Open/reference model | `celltypist-annotation` | `run_celltypist_annotation`, `summarize_celltypist_by_cluster` | `celltypist` | none | Per-cell inference is standalone; optional grouping consensus is separate. Declares a readiness probe: the cached classifier filenames reach the model's instructions at session start, so model choice needs no filesystem search |
| Open/reference model | `scimilarity-annotation` (0.5.0) | `run_scimilarity_annotation`, `summarize_scimilarity_by_cluster`, `query_reference_cells` | `scimilarity` | none | Standalone raw-count/gene/model inference with embedding, labels, and novelty distance; live CRC run from blank state succeeded with 15,040 overlapping genes and zero floor denials. `organism` is required with no default and is verified against the organism-specific parts of both model vocabularies, refusing a contradiction before any model loads (overridable, recorded); overlap alone cannot see species. Annotation exposes `knn_k`/`weighting`, surfaces SCimilarity's own per-cell vote margins (`vs_second`, `vs_all`), and supports constrained annotation over a validated `target_celltypes` safelist run from the same embeddings as the unconstrained call. `query_reference_cells` searches the reference cell atlas in two modes — `centroid` over any obs grouping or explicit cell set, and `cells` for per-cell search capped at 10 by default — returning reference cell-type/tissue/disease/study composition, distance distribution, k-relative coherence, study/sample enrichment, and a reference-background enrichment comparison, with `exclude_studies` for self-matching references, one index load per call, refusal instead of truncation, and a budget-fitted inline view that states what it trimmed. Declares a readiness probe reporting each organism's model path, completeness, reference vocabulary size, and cell-search index size |
| Visualization | `visualize-single-cell` (0.2.0) | `plot_qc_distributions`, `plot_qc_embedding`, `plot_embedding`, `plot_group_composition`, `plot_label_agreement`, `plot_marker_expression` | `gpu-singlecell` | none | Figure-per-question tools return pixels for inspection; dedicated QC-on-embedding view, cardinality-aware layout, and tables behind plots |

## Standard executable skill anatomy

An executable package normally contains:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-id>/
├── SKILL.md                 # when/why/how and interpretation boundaries
├── capability.yaml         # strict tool schema, environment, activity label, floors, optional readiness probe
├── scripts/                # deterministic implementation beside the science (incl. readiness.py when assets are required)
├── references/             # detailed method, state, and interpretation contracts
├── evals/evals.json        # model-choice and scientific-behavior cases
└── agents/openai.yaml      # optional cross-agent metadata
```

Tests live under `tests/` and must distinguish deterministic contracts from model-behavior evals.
Large results become registered artifacts; scripts write only to the supplied staging directory;
the executor validates and atomically commits state/artifact changes after tool completion.

## How the model should select skills

1. Read current session facts and artifact identities.
2. State the next scientific uncertainty, not the next pipeline stage.
3. Choose the smallest focused skill that can resolve it.
4. Check method assumptions and environment health before consequential compute.
5. Inspect result facts, warnings, tables, and figures after commit.
6. Replan or request guidance when evidence conflicts or design metadata is insufficient.

Optional methods are not mandatory steps. CellBender requires suitable raw droplets; integration
requires a justified current batch decision; predicted doublets are reviewed before removal; and
reference-model labels remain hypotheses until DEG-first adjudication.

## Adding or strengthening a skill

Follow `docs/capability-authoring.md` and the migration sequence in `docs/handoff.md`. Start from a
scientific responsibility in `docs/scientific-parity.md`, inspect legacy/BioNeMo sources only for
requirements, define state/lineage effects before coding, implement the focused package, add
contract/floor/recovery tests and model evals, run the exact brokered runtime, inspect artifacts,
then update this catalog and `docs/current-state.md` with the achieved validation level.
