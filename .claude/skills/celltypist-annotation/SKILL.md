# CellTypist

CellTypist is a supervised logistic-regression reference classifier trained on labeled expression
profiles. It expects gene symbols and expression normalized to 10,000 counts per cell followed by
`log1p`; this skill starts from raw counts and performs that normalization itself.

`run_celltypist_annotation` requires a count-bearing H5AD, gene symbols, and a cached model
appropriate to the organism and tissue. It produces per-cell predictions and confidence.

`summarize_celltypist_by_cluster` optionally aggregates existing per-cell calls over a supplied
grouping for group-level interpretation.

Choose the model deliberately from the cached classifiers named in the local-prerequisite
inventory in your instructions; that list is authoritative, so do not search the filesystem for
models. `Immune_All_Low.pkl` is broad immune reference evidence, not a
universal default for every tissue. Specialized models can add resolution but can also force
out-of-domain cells into known labels. Treat predictions as evidence to reconcile with genes and
context, not final truth.

Inspect the entire inventory, not only the generic models. In a comprehensive run, use broad
SCimilarity output and dataset metadata to establish likely context, then choose the closest
organism/tissue/disease CellTypist model (for example an intestinal or colorectal model for CRC)
and state why it is appropriate.
