# Marker Annotation Evidence

Call `evaluate_marker_evidence` for a supplied grouping column and appropriate expression matrix.
This produces candidates and competing evidence for later label adjudication.

Inspect statistically supported positive DEGs, expression fractions, log-fold changes, marker
coverage, shared-marker ambiguity, and specificity-weighted overlap. Reject candidates driven by
ambient RNA, generic stress/cell-cycle programs, or a single gene. An `insufficient` overlap is not
a negative label; it means the supplied marker programs do not support that candidate. Generalize
labels when subtype evidence is weak. Add tissue-specific marker sets through `marker_sets` when
the built-in broad programs are insufficient, and cite their source in the analysis rationale.

Separate look-alike programs on their full positive and negative evidence. A `GZMB`-high cluster is
not a plasma cell without immunoglobulin/secretory markers (`MZB1`, `JCHAIN`, `SDC1`, `XBP1`,
`IGHG1`); consider plasmacytoid dendritic cells when their defining program (`LILRA4`, `IL3RA`,
`CLEC4C`, `IRF7`/`TCF4`) is present. Predicted-doublet enrichment is probabilistic barcode evidence
for review, never a cell-type label.

Use at least one independent reference method when an appropriate model exists, then finalize through the gated finalization capability.

For a comprehensive analysis, use both CellTypist and SCimilarity when appropriate models are
ready, visualize their agreement, and call `review_annotation_evidence`. If only one method is
compatible, record a specific waiver. DEGs are the primary label hypothesis; reference labels,
curated programs, Cytopus-covered marker knowledge, and atlas queries corroborate or challenge it.
For human data, keep `use_cytopus=true` unless the package is unavailable or the user explicitly
opts out. The capability records whether the knowledge base loaded and which programs contributed;
Cytopus augments marker hypotheses but does not replace cluster DEGs as the primary evidence.
Do not mark the evidence resolved while any cluster remains ambiguous.
