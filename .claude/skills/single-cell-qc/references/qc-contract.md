# QC evidence and filtering contract

The standard cell metrics are total counts, detected genes, and mitochondrial-count percentage.
They describe technical or physiological signals; none alone proves a cell is unusable.

Human mitochondrial symbols commonly begin `MT-`. Mouse symbols commonly begin `mt-` or `Mt-`.
When `var_names` are Ensembl identifiers, a symbol column such as `feature_name`,
`gene_symbol`, or `mgi_symbol` is used if present.

`calculate_single_cell_qc` writes Boolean flags for the requested thresholds and reports exact
flag counts. It does not subset the object.

`filter_single_cells` and `filter_single_cell_genes` are mutation operations. Each requires an
explicit confirmation argument, saves a new H5AD, records before/after counts, refreshes affected
identities, and invalidates downstream state. They never overwrite the source.
