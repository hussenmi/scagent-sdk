"""Query the SCimilarity reference cell atlas with centroids built from selected cells.

Per-cell kNN annotation answers "what label do nearby reference cells carry". This answers a
different question: *which* reference cells is this population like — what studies, tissues,
diseases, and annotated types they come from, and how internally coherent the query is. That
evidence characterizes novel or ambiguous populations in a way a single transferred label
cannot.

Cost is the design constraint. Opening the reference index loads a multi-gigabyte nearest-
neighbor structure and the full reference cell metadata into memory, so every input, asset,
gene, organism, and selection check runs first and one index load serves every requested
group. Query counts and result sizes are bounded explicitly rather than truncated silently.

Selection planning, ranking, and bounding are pure functions over plain values so they are
deterministically testable in the control plane, where the scientific stack is absent.
